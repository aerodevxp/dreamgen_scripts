This is the place to find all userscripts I have made and will make for Dream Gen.

You need a way to run userscripts in your browser or find a browser that natively supports them. I recommend ViolentMonkey or TemperMonkey for PC and Userscripts for iOS. The scripts are intended to work on any platform, unless stated other wise in the script description.

Open one of the userscript and then click on View Raw... Most Userscripts tools will auto-detect the link and offer you to install the script.
Some scripts, like the highlighting and theme one, has modifiable settings. You can change them by modifying the .user.js file's variable in a text editor.
