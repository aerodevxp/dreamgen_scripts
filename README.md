This is the place to find all userscripts I have made and will make for Dream Gen.

You need a way to run userscripts in your browser or find a browser that natively supports them. I recommend ViolentMonkey or TemperMonkey for PC and Userscripts for iOS. The scripts are intended to work on any platform, unless stated other wise in the script description.
